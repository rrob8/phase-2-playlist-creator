      "longDescription": "Released in 1965, \"HELP!\" was the second feature film from The Beatles, who reunited with \"A Hard Day's Night\" director Richard Lester for the globetrotting comedy. After Ringo becomes unwittingly attached to a mysterious gift from a fan—a sacred ruby ring that gets stuck on his finger—the band goes on the run from a cast of characters who are determined to recover it at any cost. Evading robed cult fanatics, a diabolical scientist, and a hapless troupe of London police, John, Paul, George, and Ringo travel between Buckingham Palace, the Austrian Alps, and the Bahamas, all while delivering seven classic tracks, including \"You’ve Got to Hide Your Love Away,\" \"Another Girl,\" and \"I Need You.\"",
